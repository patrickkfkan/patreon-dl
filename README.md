# patreon-dl

A Patreon downloader written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

This repo contains the `patreon-dl` library and its command-line tool. For GUI application, check out [patreon-dl-gui](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/patreon-dl-gui).

### Features
- Access to patron-only content through cookie. This refers to content you have access to under your account. It does not include locked content that you don't have a subscription for.
- Download posts by user, in a collection or single post.
- Download products (aka shop purchases)
- Items included in downloads:
    - videos
    - images
    - audio
    - attachments
    - embedded videos
      - YouTube downloader built-in
      - Supports [external downloader](#embedded-videos--links---external-downloader)
- Save campaign and content info 
- Extensively configurable
- Browse downloaded content through integrated web server

You can run `patreon-dl` from the command-line or [use it as a library](./docs/Library.md) for your project. Node.js v20 or higher required.

### Limitations

- Embedded links are not followed; only info about the embed is saved. Exception:
  - YouTube video link - in which case the video is downloaded; or
  - An external downloader is configured for the link provider.

For information on external downloaders, see the [Embedded videos / links - external downloader](#embedded-videos--links---external-downloader) section. Example config is provided for fetching YouTube (replacing the built-in downloader) and Vimeo videos.

### FFmpeg dependency

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is required when downloading:
- videos that are provided only in streaming format; and
- embedded YouTube videos.

Not all video downloads require FFmpeg, but you should have it installed on your system anyway.

### Embedded YouTube videos / links - Premium access

`patreon-dl` supports downloading embedded YouTube videos or from embedded YouTube video links. In addition, if you have a YouTube Premium subscription, you can connect `patreon-dl` to your account and download videos at qualities available only to Premium accounts (e.g. '1080p Premium'). For CLI users, you would configure `patreon-dl` as follows:

```
$ patreon-dl --configure-youtube
```

> ...or you may just refer to the next section on how to download enhanecd-quality videos without a Premium account.

### Embedded videos / links - external downloader

You can specify external programs to download embedded videos or from embedded links. For YouTube videos, this will replace the built-in downloader.

See the [example config](./example-embed.conf) on how to configure an external downloader to fetch YouTube and Vimeo videos through [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). For Vimeo videos, a [helper script](./bin/patreon-dl-vimeo.js) bundled with `patreon-dl` is used.

## Installation

1. First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). 
2. Then, install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (if you are going to download videos).
3. Then, in a terminal, run the following command:

   ```
   $ npm i -g patreon-dl
   ```

   The `-g` option is for installing `patreon-dl` globally and have the CLI executable added to the PATH. Depending on your usage, you might not need this.

## CLI usage

```
$ patreon-dl [OPTION]... URL
```

### OPTION

| Option    | Alias | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `--help`  | `-h`  | Display usage guide |
| <code><nobr>--config-file &lt;path&gt;</nobr></code> | `-C` | Load [configuration file](#configuration-file) at `<path>` for setting full options |
| `--cookie <string>` | `-c` | Cookie for accessing patron-only content; [how to obtain cookie](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/patreon-dl/wiki/How-to-obtain-Cookie). Enclose within double quotation marks e.g. "Cookie: patreon_device_id:..."|

### URL

#### Supported URL formats

```
// Download a product
https://www.patreon.com/<creator>/shop/<slug>-<product_id>

// Download posts by creator
https://www.patreon.com/<creator>/posts
https://www.patreon.com/c/<creator>/posts
https://www.patreon.com/cw/<creator>/posts
https://www.patreon.com/user/posts?u=<user_id>

// Dowload a single post
https://www.patreon.com/posts/<post_id>
https://www.patreon.com/posts/<slug>-<post_id>

// Download posts in a collection
https://www.patreon.com/collection/<collection_id>

```

#### Multiple URLs

You may specify multiple URLs by separating them with a comma. E.g.:

```
// First download posts by johndoe, followed by posts by janedoe.
$ patreon-dl "https://www.patreon.com/johndoe/posts,https://www.patreon.com/janedoe/posts"
```

#### Supplying URLs through file

You can also use a file to supply URLs to `patreon-dl`. For example, you can have a `urls.txt` that has the following content:

```
# Each URL is placed in its own line
# Comments (lines starting with '#') will be ignored

https://www.patreon.com/johndoe/posts
https://www.patreon.com/janedoe/posts

```

You can then pass `urls.txt` to `patreon-dl`:

```
$ patreon-dl urls.txt
```

In this file, you can also override `include` options provided in a [configuration file](#configuration-file) passed to `patreon-dl` (through the `-C` option). `include` options allow you specify what to include in downloads. This overriding mechanism allows you to specify different content to download for each target URL. For example, you might have the following `include` option in your configuration file:

```
...

[include]

# Include posts that belong only to tier ID '-1' (public tier)
posts.in.tier = -1

...
```

Then, in your `urls.txt`, you can override as follows:

```
# URL 1
https://www.patreon.com/johndoe/posts

# Override 'posts.in.tier = -1' in [include] section of configuration file.
# This will cause downloader to download posts from URL 1 belonging to tier with
# ID '123456' or '789100'.

include.posts.in.tier = 123456, 789100

# Other include options - they basically have the same name as those
# in the configuation file, but prepended with 'include.':
#
# include.locked.content
# include.posts.with.media.type
# include.posts.published.after
# include.posts.published.before
# include.campaign.info
# include.content.info
# include.preview.media
# include.content.media
# include.all.media.variants
# include.images.by.filename
# include.audio.by.filename
# include.attachments.by.filename
# include.comments

# URL 2 
https://www.patreon.com/janedoe/posts

# If you don't place any 'include.*' statements here, the downloader will use
# options from configuration file or default values if none provided.

# URL 3
...

```

### Directory structure

Content is saved with the following directory structure:
```
out-dir
    ├── campaign
        ├── campaign_info
        ├── posts
        │   ├── post 1
        │   │   ├── post_info
        │   │   ├── images
        │   │   ├── ...
        │   ├── post 2
        │       ├── post_info
        │       ├── images
        │       ├── ...
        ├──shop
            ├── product 1
                ├── product_info
                ├── content_media
                ├── ...
```


### Configuration file

Command-line options are limited. To access the full range of options, create a configuration file and pass it to `patreon-dl` with the (capital) `-C` option.

Refer to the [example config](./example.conf) to see what options are offered. Also see [How to obtain Cookie](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/patreon-dl/wiki/How-to-obtain-Cookie).

Note that you can override an option from a configuration file with one provided at the command-line, provided of course that a command-line equivalent is available.

## Browsing downloaded content

`patreon-dl` comes with a web server that allows you to browse downloaded content. To start the web server:

```
$ patreon-dl-server [OPTION]
```

### OPTION

| Option    | Alias | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `--help`  | `-h`  | Display usage guide |
| `--data-dir <dir>` |`-i` | Directory containing downloaded content. Default: current working directory |
| `--port <number>` |`-p` | Web server port. Default: `3000`, or a random port if `3000` is already in use. |
| `--log-level <level>` | `-l` | Log level of the console logger: `info`, `debug`, `warn` or `error`; set to `none` to disable the logger. Default: `info` |
| `--log-file <file>` | `-f` | Save logs to `<file>`. |


### Example usage

Say you downloaded something with `patreon-dl`:

```
$ patreon-dl -o "C:\PatreonDownloads" <url>
```

This will download content to `C:\PatreonDownloads`. To view the downloaded content, start `patreon-dl` server as follows:

```
$ patreon-dl-server -i "C:\PatreonDownloads"

...info: Web server is running on <URL>
```

Note the URL shown in the output. Open this URL in a web browser to begin viewing the downloaded content.

> Keep in mind that the web server is in no way secure. It is meant for local browsing and should not be exposed to outside parties!
